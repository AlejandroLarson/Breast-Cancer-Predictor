# Breast-Cancer-Predictor
## Overview
The Breast Cancer diagnosis app uses machine learning to assist medical professionals in
diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of measurements the app can predict if a breast mass
is benign or malignant. It provides a radar chart to display the information and provides
the predicted diagnosiis and probability of it being benign or malignant. One can also 
manually input measurements using the sidebar. 

The app uses the public data set [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data](Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set)
and is for educational purposes.

A live version of the app has been deployed using [https://breast-cancer-predictor-2024.streamlit.app/](Streamlit Community Cloud).
